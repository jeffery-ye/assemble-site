          <p id = "essayText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've faced hardships, challenges, and failures for my entire life, and I believe that they're fundamental 
            for future success. As { getAorAn(getSnippet(adjectives_list)) }&nbsp;{ getSnippet(org_list) }, my life was shaped by my experience 
            with { getSnippet(issues_list) }. Ever since I { getSnippet(scenario_list) }, and my mother was run over 
            by { getAorAn(getSnippet(vehic_list)) }, dying instantly, I've been living with my { getSnippet(caretaker_list) } who { getSnippet(crimes_list) } and 
            does { getSnippet(hobby_list) } in their spare time. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My life had been relatively easy up until this point, but everything changed 
            when I { getSnippet(events_list) }. I was on the brink of death for { Math.random()*50 } whole { getSnippet(times_list) } before the doctors said I would pull 
            through. From that point on, I pulled my life together. I graduated high school with a { Math.floor(Math.random()*3) + "." + Math.floor(Math.random()*9) } GPA.
            I knew that I wanted to go to { getSnippet(school_list) } and become the best { getSnippet(job_list) } the world has ever seen. Hope to see you all on campus next fall!</p>

          <p id = "essayText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've experienced a life changing event that completely and irreversibly altered my outlook on life before.
            It affected how I viewed the world and thought about things. For much of my life, I felt stuck. I wasn't advancing, growing, or becoming a better person. 
            I had been working as { getAorAn(getSnippet(job_list)) } for { Math.random()*10 }&nbsp;{ getSnippet(times_list) }. Every day was the same; wake up, 
            go to work riding { getAorAn(getSnippet(vehic_list)) }, come home, and make dinner for my { getSnippet(caretaker_list) } who &nbsp;
            { getSnippet(crimes_list) }. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But suddenly, on a day like any other, I { getSnippet(events_list) }. This event changed my entire life for the better. 
            I quit my job, packed my bags, and set off to { getSnippet(place_list) }. I've since then viewed every day I live like an adventure, and grown 
            greatly as a { getSnippet(org_list) }. Now that I finally know what I'm doing in life, I'm applying to you: { getSnippet(school_list) }, in hopes that
            you can help me achieve greatness as the best { getSnippet(job_list) } I can be.</p>

          and ride a {getSnippet(vehic_list) } for transportation. I had to get a job as { getAorAn(getSnippet(job_list)) } and deal with { getSnippet(issues_list) }. This experience taught me what it meant to truly have nothing.
          I had to move in with { getAorAn(getSnippet(org_list)) }, who I learned humility, respect, and { getSnippet(hobby_list) } from. <br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That time in my life was truly special, and now that
           I've become the best person I can, I am now applying to further my education in hopes of becoming { getAorAn(getSnippet(job_list)) }. When I look back to
